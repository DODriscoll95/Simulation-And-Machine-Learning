# Simulation-And-Machine-Learning (88%)
Simulation and Machine Learning project as part of MSc Mathematical Finance at University of Warwick

This is a project I completed as part of my MSc in Mathematical Finance for the Simulation and Machine Learning for Finance Class.

The first half of the project involved the pricing different types of options using Monte Carlo methods along with some variance reduction techniques.

The second half of the projects relates to machine learning, specifically using a support vector machine classifier and neural networks, using multi-layer perceptron regessors.

The project tasks can be found in the project pdf.
