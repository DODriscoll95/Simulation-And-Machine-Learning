    "To compute the delta we will use a combination of path recycling and antithetic variance reduction. We use path recycling as opposed to standard finite difference methods because the variance of the standard finite differencing methods can be large, and can cause problems if the change in the parameter theta tends to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the centered finite difference approach as follows :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\theta} (\\theta_j) = \\frac{V_{j+1} - V_{j-1}}{2\\Delta\\theta} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta\\theta^2) $$\n",

    "\n",
    "So we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Var\\left[\\frac{V_{j+1} - V_{j-1}}{2\\Delta\\theta}\\right] \\approx Var\\left[\\frac{dV}{d\\theta}\\theta_j \\right] $$\n",

    "Where the variance on the right-hand-side is the variance in a sample mean of the derivative we are trying to approximate. We will then combine this pathrecycling method with antithetic variance reduction techniques which we are familiar with.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also compute the delta using pathwise derivatives with antithetic variance reduction or using likelihood ratio methods but these methods can get complicated for more exotic and complicated options where the formula for the derivative isnt easily calculated analytically. But one useful feature of using likelihood ratio methods is that it can be used in cases where the option payoff is discontinuous.\n",

    "From our analysis of our different monte carlo methods, using antithetic variance reduction performed the best in terms of needing the smallest sample size of all the methods to have a maxiumum absolute error of 0.01 hence the variance reduction performed the best here. With the smaller sample size this method will also be faster than the other methods which can be important in a high frequency trading setting where speed and accuracy is essential. \n",

    "In our exploratory analysis we see how that the longer the maturity time, the lower the delta of the contract for the same spot prices, which makes sense as the change in the option value will fluctuate less if there is a longer time to maturity. However when the spot price is far lower than the first strike price K1 we notice how the option with maturity time 10 has a higher price than that of contracts with a smaller time to maturity. This is because there is more time for the spot price to move in a direction that would bring the option in the money for us, but as the spot price gets closer to K1 the shorter maturity time contracts start to become more valuable. (This may not always be true however depending on how large sigma (volatility) is"
